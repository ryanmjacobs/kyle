            <p>My name is Kyle Domen, founder of HOTDOMEN.COM</p>

            <p>
               One night, many moons ago, I had a dream. A dream in which
               <em>anyone, anywhere</em> was greeted with exclusive access
               to <em>all</em> things Domen. Where every device was given the
               <em>sweet, sweet</em> luxury of me.
            </p>

            <p>
               When I woke up, in that pristine moment, I knew what I had to do.
               In that vivid clarity, I knew my life's purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
               I envisioned HOTDOMEN.
            </p>

            <p>
               And now that vision, is no longer a vision. It's a reality.
